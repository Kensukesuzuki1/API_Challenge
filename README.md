# API-Challenge
This Repository analyzes how Latitude is correlated to: Temperature,  Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed. 

# How to run
Put your API Key code in api_keys.py to run analysis. 

# Limitation of the Dataset 
This Analysis was run on 3/18/2020. The results may differ based on when the analysis is run. 

# Observations and Insights
For WeatherPy, here are some observations and insights that can be made from the data:

There is a relationship between a city's latitude and maximum temperature in both the northern and southern hemisphere. That is, as you go farther away from the equator, a city's maximum temperature will get colder. The correlation between latitude and temperature is stronger in the North. 

There is a very weak, positive correlation between a city's latitude and humidity for both the northern and southern hemispheres. There appears to be a cluster of low humidity with a latitude from 10 to 40.  As a whole, latitude does not seem to be a significant factor in predicting humidity. 

There is a very weak, positive correlation between cloud cover and a city's latitude for both the northern and southern hemispheres. There is a very weak, positive correlation for the northern hemisphere between a city's latitude and wind speed (mph), and there is a very weak, negative correlation for the southern hemisphere for those same two factors. As a whole, latitude does not seem to be a significant factor in predicting cloud cover or wind speed.
